You may organize your plugin into directories, however, consider how people 
will likely use this repository, as a folder that is pointed to by 
the `--plugins=` flag.  Therefore, make sure you have an `__init__.py` 
(even if empty) in your directories and subdirectories.  See the [Volatility Wiki](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Volatility-Usage#specifying-additional-plugin-directories) for more details
